# Halucinate-in-my-room
Project Idea: Train a Nerf of my living room and wrap the model to a camera positioning enginine (game engine), then querry images based on user inputs. At the same time, laverage a generative model (stable diffusion) such that the model may halucinate once the bounadries of the recorded data of the room has been reached.

Task list:

NeRF
 - Record Data []
 - Prepare Data []
 - Code backbone []
 - Train, tune etc. []
 - Wrap the model in a game loop with appropriate inputs []

Stable diffusion
 - Read up on stable diffusion lol
