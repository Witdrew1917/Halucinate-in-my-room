# Halucinate-in-my-room
Project Idea: Train a Nerf of my living room and wrap the model to a camera positioning enginine (game engine), then querry images based on user inputs. At the same time, laverage a generative model (stable diffusion) such that the model may halucinate once the bounadries of the recorded data of the room has been reached.
